                This action attribute will not work on GitHub Pages because it references "localhost," which is a special hostname that points to the local machine running the application. GitHub Pages is a static hosting service and does not support running server-side code or connecting to local servers.

            <p>
                This action attribute can work on GitHub Pages because it references a publicly accessible URL hosted on Heroku. GitHub Pages can send form data to external servers as long as they are publicly reachable over the internet.
